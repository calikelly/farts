# FartsPlugin

A just-for-fun RuneLite plugin that adds fart sounds and IBS effects in to the game!

## Settings:
- `Chat Fart`, Enable or disables chat triggers
- `Fart Volume`, Audi volume control
- `IBS Mode`, Enable or disable IBS triggers by eating Pizzas
- `Raspberry Fart`, Enable or disable audio triggers by players doing Raspberry emote

## Chat Triggers:
`*fart*`, `*farts*`, `(fart)`, `(farts)` in the game chat will all trigger fart sounds.

## Raspberry emote:
Any player who uses the Raspberry emote will trigger fart sounds.

## IBS Symptoms:
Eat any Pizza and you will fart every 20-30 seconds for around 5 minutes.

## Future:
- Proximity based volume
- More IBS triggers and effects (e.g `stress`)
- Visible IBS symptoms (e.g `nausea`, `cramps`) + visual timer
